👋 Hi, I’m Nick, a PhD candidate in the Computational Journalism Lab at Northwestern University. I research how collective attention works in large, complex systems. 

💻 I'm a computational social scientist who writes a lot of code in Python, SQL, and R. 

‼️ I'm on the job market, open to research and data science positions. Right now, I'm a part-time research engineer at Meta. In early 2022, I interned with Patreon's data science team.
