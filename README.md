ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick, a postdoctoral scholar at Northwestern University, where I study applications of generative AI in journalism. Starting fall 2026, I'll be an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota.  I also have a PhD from NU, where I researched how collective attention works in large, complex systems. 

ðŸ’» I'm a computational social scientist who writes code in Python and SQL.
